Cratic Ai

Install Steps:

1. Install Node.JS
2. Install Mongo
3. Install Yarn
4. Clone This Repository To Your Local Environment
5. Run yarn install in the project root directory
6. Run yarn dev in the project root directory

Notes: 
- In case of problems make sure MongoDB is turned on and available at localhost:27017
- You may have to make changes to the server.js file, the index.js file
- There is extra code that may be distracting, and not part of the core functionality. DON'T DELETE IT, commenting out is ok, but your task is to work around it
- Your challenge is to figure out how to get this running, make the changes, and get it hosted, without restarting from scratch (even though that may be faster)
