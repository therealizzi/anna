This is a practice repo for developers who want to work for Cratic

How To Apply for job at Cratic:

1. Go here: https://github.com/therealizzi/anna
2. Fork the code, get it running on your local computer
3. Setup a database with mongodb
4. Add a small feature / widget (must incorporate user text input, storage, and at least one third-party API)
5. Add a few basic designs to the feature, and make responsive / mobile friendly
6. Host the app on a new domain (use your own domain, publish it, make it live)
7. Send a link, with a short bio about yourself, and your reasoning for wanting to work for Cratic Ai to careers@cratic.ai 

- Your challenge is to figure out how to get this running, make the changes, get it hosted, and without re-starting from scratch (even though that may be faster)

If you complete this challenge, we will be very excited to meet you.

Other Notes: 
- This exercise is testing (a) your ability to work in our code environment, (b) to use existing code to solve new problems, (c) to think for yourself and come up with new solutions, (d) to make basic UI/UX decisions, and (e) to pull it all together and put live code on the internet
- There is extra code that will be distracting, and not part of the core functionality. DON'T DELETE IT. Commenting out is ok, but your task is to work around it
- You may have to make changes to the server.js file, the index.js file, and other files
- You can add extra NPM packages or other frameworks if you want, just so long as it supports the requirements listed above

- Contact careers@cratic.ai if you have questions or to clarify these instructions, but not for help with this challenge
